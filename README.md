Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The dataset being used for this project is the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" available on hte UCI web page:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

"run_analysis.R" contains the r-code needed to provide the expected result.

The script "run_analysis.R" performs as outlined in the project description by:

- Merging the training and test sets to one data set.
- Extracting the measurements of the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Assigning descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Labeling the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- And finally exporting the tidy data set into the file "activity-rec-avg.txt".

In addition, all source files have been assigned to variables. All variables are explained in the file "codebook.md".
